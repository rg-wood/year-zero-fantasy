# Year Zero Fantasy

Simple fantasy hack of the Year Zero Engine

## Player Characters

How you create your player character is explained in detail in this
chapter. The summary below is a helpful overview. Grab a character
sheet, a pencil, and follow these steps:

1.  Determine your [attributes](#attributes).
2.  Determine your [talents](#talents).
3.  Determine your [Health](#health) and [Resolve](#resolve).
4.  Determine your personality traits.
5.  Pick your gear.
6.  Choose a name.

### Attributes

Your character has four attributes that indicate your basic physical and
mental capabilities. Your attributes are used when you are
[rolling](#rolling) to perform actions in the game, and also determine
how much [damage and stress](#damage-and-stress) can withstand before
you become [broken](#broken).

Distribute 14 points across your attributes. You can assign no less than
2 and no more than 5 points to any attribute.

- **STRENGTH:** Raw muscle power and brawn.
- **AGILITY:** Body control, speed, and motor skills.
- **WITS:** Sensory perception, intelligence, and sanity.
- **EMPATHY:** Personal charisma and ability to manipulate others.

### Talents

Your talents are the knowledge and abilities you have acquired during
your life. They are important, as they determine, along with your
[attributes](#attributes), how effectively you can perform certain
actions in the game.

Talents give you +1 to +3 bonus dice to your [base dice
pool](#base-dice), depending on their level. Some talents may give you
other benefits, which are listed in their descriptions.

You can distribute 5 points across your starting talents.

#### Defender

You gain a bonus equal to the level of this talent to defend allies
within SHORT distance of you.

#### Necromancer

You gain a bonus equal to the level of this talent to speak with the
undead. Additionally, you can use WITS to sense the presence of the
undead. Some [equipment](#equipment) can give you [Gear
Dice](#gear-dice) that can be added to the roll.

### Health

Your starting Health equals your Strength and Agility scores.

### Resolve

Your starting Resolve equals your Wits and Empathy scores.

## Rolling

Roleplaying is a conversation. The GM describes the scene, you describe
how your PCs behave, the GM describes how any NPCs react, you reply, and
it goes back and forth. But sooner or later, a decisive situation will
arise, a point of no return, a conflict that conversation alone cannot
resolve. Then it's time to break out the dice.

### Base Dice

To roll, grab a number of six-sided dice equal to the most relevant
attribute. These are your base dice. Then roll all the dice together.

SUCCESS: To succeed with your action, you must roll at least one 6. A 6
is called a success.If you roll several 6s, you get several successes.

NO TALENT? If you don't have a relevant talent for the particalar action
you want to perform, you can roll anyway -- simply roll the base dice
for your attribute alone.

#### Gear Dice

Useful gear can give you extra dice to roll, called a gear bonus.

For every bane (1) you roll on your base dice from gear when pushing,
the item's gear bonus is decreased by one. It simply doesn't work as
well anymore. If the gear bonus reaches zero, the item is broken and
cannot be used. The gear bonus of an item can be reduced by external
damage as well.

### Modifiers

Sometimes, external factors help you to succeed. Such modifiers will
give you additional base dice to roll. Other times, something hampers
your action. This removes base dice from your pool. You can get such
modifiers to skill rolls in several different ways: talents, the
difficulty of the action itself, and help from others.

A +1 modifier means you roll one extra base die, +2 means you roll two
extra base dice, and so on. A −1 modifier means you roll one base die
fewer than normal, −2 means two fewer, and so on. Several modifiers can
apply to the same roll, and they are cumulative.

Always add and remove base dice from your skills, if you can (not from
attributes or gear). If you don't have enough dice from skills, remove
base dice from gear. If you run out of gear dice as well, remove base
dice from attributes. If you end up with no dice at all, you have no
chance to succeed -- time to rethink your strategy!

### Complicated Success

If you only roll one success, you reach your stated goal, but also gain
some additional complication, depending on the situation and the skill
used. The GM should make a soft [reaction](#reactions).

### Failure

If you roll no success, something goes wrong. For some reason, you
failed to achieve your goal. A failed roll will have further
consequences and should move the story forward in a dramatic way.
Outside of [combat](#combat), the GM should make a hard
[reaction](#reactions).

You have one last chance if you really need to succeed -- you can push
the roll.

### Reactions

Whenever everyone looks to you to see what happens or the rules say,
choose a reaction.

A **soft reaction** is one without immediate, irrevocable consequences.
That usually means it's something not all that bad, like revealing that
there's more treasure if they can just find a way past the golem (offer
an opportunity with cost). It can also mean that it's something bad, but
they have time to avoid it, like hearing an approaching band of goblin
archers with a chance to hide from them.

A soft reaction ignored becomes a golden opportunity for a hard
reaction.

**Hard reactions**, on the other hand, have immediate consequences.

Possible reactions include:

- Reveal an unwelcome truth
- Show signs of an approaching threat
- Use up resources
- Turn their action back on them
- Separate them
- Offer an opportunity
- Put someone on the spot
- Give them a hard choice

### Pushing

If you fail your initial roll, or if you want additional successes, you
can lean into the action, giving it everything you've got, pushing
yourself to the limit. This is called a **push**, and lets you re-roll
any dice that don't show the result of 1.

How a pushed roll plays out in story terms depends on what skill you are
using. It can take the form of a great physical exertion, total mental
focus, or emotional strain.

#### Banes

A base die showing a 1 is called a bane and can never be re-rolled when
pushing. After a push, you cannot change back to the previous result.
All dice count after the push, even any dice you didn't re-roll.

### Damage & Stress

Damage and stress to characters can reduce your [Health](#health) and
[Resolve](#resolve) scores and cause [critical
injuries](#critical-injuries).

You can suffer damage in many ways. These are the most common:

- PUSHING: [Pushing](#pushing) can inflict damage and stress. Armor has
  no effect against damage from pushing.
- ATTACKS: Whenever you [attack](#attacks) someone in [combat](#combat),
  you inflict damage equal to the base damage rating of the weapon, plus
  one additional point of damage for each extra success rolled beyond
  the first. The same goes for damage from explosions, fire, etc.
- STRESSFUL SITUATIONS: When your PC is subjected to fear or a stressful
  situation, the GM determines the potential stress inflicted (see the
  table below). You then make an Empathy roll (not an action) -- each
  success rolled eliminates one point of potential stress. You can push
  the roll, but at the risk of suffering even more stress if you get any
  on the re-roll.

  Factor Stress

  ***

  Being threatened with violence 1

  Witnessing a horrible supernatural event 3

  : Stressful Situations {#stressful-situations}

#### Broken

Your PC can be broken by [damage or stress](#damage-and-stress). You are
broken if [Health](#health) or [Resolve](#resolve) are reduced to zero.
basically means you are taken out of action, and you might risk even
lethal injuries. When broken, you can't perform any actions or make
rolls.

You can't go below zero in [Health](#health) or [Resolve](#resolve). If
you suffer further damage, you may suffer an additional [critical
injury](#critical-injuries) however.

### Critical Injuries

Critical injuries are dangerous, even lethal, injuries to your body or
mind. You suffer a physical critical injury when your [Health](#health)
is reduced to zero, and a mental critical injury when your
[Resolve](#resolve) is reduced to zero.

When you suffer a critical injury, roll on the relevant table below to
see what it is.
